## Dynamic Typing

JavaScript is loosely typed, and dynamic. The following is possible, but ill-advised.

```javascript
let foo = 42;    // foo is now a number
foo     = 'bar'; // foo is now a string
foo     = true;  // foo is now a boolean
```

**Note**: TypeSript solves this problem by adding strong typing.

## JavaScript Types

- Primitives
  - Boolean
  - Null
  - Undefined
  - Number
  - BigInt
  - String
  - Symbol
- Objects

## Notable Objects

- Arrays and typed Arrays
- Maps, WeakMaps
- Sets, WeakSets
- Date
- Error
- RegExp
- Promise
- Generator
- WebAssembly

All Standard Objects <https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects>
