# Lesson 2: JavaScript

## Overview of JavaScript

- Dynamically Typed

- First-class functions

- Supports event-driven, functional, object-oriented, and imperative programming

## Useful Tips

### Equality Comparisons and Sameness

Typically in many programming languages, you'd use the `==` operator. This operator exists in JavaScript, but it works loosely, so there may be unexpected results.

**Instead, use `===` to get strict equality between variables.**
